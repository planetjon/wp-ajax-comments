An all-AJAX drop-in for the stock comments system.

== Description ==
Make your site navigation menu mobile-ready. When the threshold is reached, the targeted menu will collapse into a hamburger menu.
This plugin is a zero-dependency refresh on Mean Theme's MeanMenu plugin. This means that it does not require jQuery.


AJAX Comments Refueled allows for pages to be cached without needing to invalidate on new comments,
and is useful for upgrading the default comment system to not rely on page refreshes for replying to comments.

== How To Use ==
Simply install and activate this plugin and it will work - there are no options to fuss over.

== Installation ==
Simply upload the zip using the Add New Plugin feature within WordPress admin as per usual.
