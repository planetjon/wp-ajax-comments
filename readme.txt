An all-AJAX drop-in for the stock comments system.

== Description ==
AJAX Comments Refueled allows for pages to be cached without needing to invalidate on new comments, and is useful for upgrading the default comment system to not rely on page refreshes for replying to comments.

This plugin is a zero-dependency implementation. This means that it does not require jQuery.
